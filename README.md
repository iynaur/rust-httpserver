### Rust http server / backend boilerplate

this is a boilerplate rust project to get an http server up and running in no time

#### Why rust+actix ?

rust is known to be the fastest (atleast it tries to) language in the means of performance and safety and efficiency.

actix is a library for actors, so when combined with rust http server it will spawn new actors to handle the requests simultaneously, this will result in much much more capacity and performance

combining these two bad boys will result in an incredible performance

also rust type safety makes sure everything will run where it should be.

#### Usecases

Rust http servers are mostly used for building fancy and fast API networks

Any low end systems needing an http server to work with

### Installing and usage

The project is using cargo project management system.
